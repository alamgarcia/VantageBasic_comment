  those relating to the formation, interpretation, breach or termination of these Software

  of law principles, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt">Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance

  shall give the other party written notice of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good
  faith
  to resolve each Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longer period as the parties
  may
  mutually agree, following the delivery of such notice, by negotiations between designated
  representatives of the parties who have dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that
  arose
  anywhere other than in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed
  anywhere
  other than in the United States cannot be settled under these procedures and within these
  timeframes, it will be conclusively determined upon request of either party by a final and

  International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or
  (failing

  (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims and counterclaims by

  one party against any or all other parties exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all
  claims,
  including cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in
  accordance
  with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of three
  arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International
  Chamber
  of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location agreed
  by
  the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have
  authority only to award compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of these
  Software License Terms and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The arbitrator(s)
  will
  not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of these Software
  License
  Terms. The ruling by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be
  entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. The
  parties
  will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)’ fees, but each party will bear its own
  attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The parties, their
  representatives, other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content
  and
  results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any
  disclosure of the existence, content and results of the arbitration shall be as limited and
  narrowed as required to comply with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the
  applicable law mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award only,
  the
  underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be disclosed. </p>

  either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States
  District Court for the Southern District of New York. Except as otherwise stated above with

  these Software License Terms consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts,

  Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid,
  these Software License Terms will not be rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and

  original provision within the limits of applicable law. The failure to assert any rights
  under
  the Software License Terms, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate in the

  of breach or default, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each

  any
  Software, and as a result of such move, a jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee
  (including withholding taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any
  such Software), then you are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any such duty, taxes, levy
  or
  other fees.
