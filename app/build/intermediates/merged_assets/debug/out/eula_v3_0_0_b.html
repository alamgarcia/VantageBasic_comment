Beta Software License Terms and any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
of or relating to these Beta Software License Terms ("<b>Dispute</b>"),
including without limitation those relating to the formation, interpretation,
breach or termination of these Beta Software License Terms, or any issue
regarding whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration under these Beta Software
License Terms, will be governed by New York State laws, excluding conflict of
law principles, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt">Any Dispute shall be resolved
in accordance with the following provisions. The disputing party shall give the
other party written notice of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good
faith to resolve each Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longe
period as the parties may mutually agree, following the delivery of such
notice, by negotiations between designated representatives of the parties who
have dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than
in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere
other than in the United States cannot be settled under these procedures and
within these timeframes, it will be conclusively determined upon request of
either party by a final and binding arbitration proceeding to be held in
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement)
by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of
Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims
and counterclaims by any one party against any or all other parties exceed One
Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including cross claims and
counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in accordance with the
Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of
three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the
English language, at a location agreed by the parties or (failing agreement)
ordered by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to
award compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of these Beta
Software License Terms and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The
arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify
the terms of these Beta Software License Terms. The ruling by the arbitrator(s)
will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. The parties will evenly
split the cost of the arbitrator(s)' fees, but each party will bear its own
attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The parties,
their representatives, other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the
existence, content and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the
fullest extent permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and
results of the arbitration shall be as limited and narrowed as required to
comply with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law
mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award only,
the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be disclosed. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt">If a Dispute by one party
against the other that arose in the United States or is based upon an alleged
breach committed in the United States cannot be settled under the procedures
and within the timeframe set forth above, then either party may bring an action
or proceeding solely in either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Except as otherwise stated above with regard to arbitration of Disputes
that arise anywhere other than in the United States or are based upon an
alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States, each party
to these Beta Software License Terms consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of
those courts, including their appellate courts, for the purpose of all actions
and proceedings.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:10.0pt">The parties agree that the
arbitration provision in this section may be enforced by injunction or other equitable
order, and no bond or security of any kind will be required with respect to any
such injunction or order. Nothing in this section will be construed to preclude
either party from seeking provisional remedies, including but not limited to
temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of
competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its rights
pending arbitration, at any time. In addition and notwithstanding the
foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take any necessary legal action at any
time, including without limitation seeking immediate injunctive relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect Avaya's intellectual
property and its confidential or proprietary information (including but not

Software License Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, these Beta
Software License Terms will not be rendered unenforceable or invalid as a
whole, and the provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best
accomplish the objectives of the original provision within the limits of
applicable law. The failure to assert any rights under the Beta Software
License Terms, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate in the
event of breach or default, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the
right to enforce each and every provision of the Beta Software License Terms in
accordance with their terms. If you move any Beta Software, and as a result of
such move, a jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including
withholding taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of

such duty, taxes, levy or other fees. </p>
